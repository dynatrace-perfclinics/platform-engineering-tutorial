### Hands-On 5: Explore the Platform Observability Use Cases (WORK IN PROGRESS)

While we have focused a lot about automating the observability of our deployed apps its now time to discuss how we can observe the platform components such as ArgoCD, GitLab, Backstage, OpenTelemetry, ...

For this we have a couple of dashboards & notebooks prepared that show how we can use observability signals (logs, metrics, traces ...) from those systems to provide platform engineering teams a good overview of the health of their platform.
